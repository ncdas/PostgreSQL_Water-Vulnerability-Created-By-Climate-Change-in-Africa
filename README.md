# (PostgreSQL)Water-Vulnerability-Created-By-Climate-Change-in-Africa

### Exploratory Data Analysis in SQL

We'll be working with data from the Climate change adaptation innovation in the water sector in Africa paper which can be found [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340922009854).

This study looked at the response of technology to water vulnerability created by climate change in Africa.

The data used for adaptation technology was water-related patent data. The water stress index accounts for things like projected change of annual runoff, projected change of annual groundwater recharge, fresh water withdrawal rate, water dependency ratio, dam capacity, and access to reliable drinking water. A higher index indicates higher vulnerability.

The other variables are used to define the country's size (GDP), institutional effectiveness, research and development activity, and knowledge base.

The fields included in this dataset are:

  - year (data has been pooled for the following years: 1990, 2000, 2005, and 2010 to 2016)
  - adaptation technologies
  - openness to trade (trade as percentage of gross domestic product)
  - time required to register property (calendar days)
  - gross domestic product per capital
  - employers (total)
  - gross enrolment ratio
  - water stress index.
